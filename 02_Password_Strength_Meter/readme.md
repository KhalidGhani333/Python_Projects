# 🔐 Project : Password Strength Meter  

## 📌 Objective  
Create a **Password Strength Meter** in Python that evaluates user passwords based on **security best practices**. This program will:  

✅ **Analyze password strength** based on length, character variety, and patterns.  
✅ **Assign a security rating**: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.  
✅ **Provide real-time feedback** to help users improve weak passwords.  
  

🔹 **Additional Features & Challenges**  
🚀 **Password Generator** – Suggests strong, randomized passwords.  
🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI** – Build a **Streamlit-powered** graphical interface.  
⛔ **Blacklist Weak Passwords** – Rejects commonly used passwords like `"password123"`.
