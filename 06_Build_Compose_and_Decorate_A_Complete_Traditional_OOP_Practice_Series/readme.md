## 📘 Python OOP Assignments Collection 🚀
Welcome to the Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment series!
This repository is a hands-on guide to mastering OOP concepts using real-world examples in Python 🐍.

**🧠 What You'll Learn**
✨ Instance, class, and static methods
🔐 Access modifiers (public, protected, private)
📦 Composition & Aggregation
🧱 Inheritance & Method Resolution Order (MRO)
⚙️ Decorators & Special Methods
📈 Custom Exceptions
🔁 Iterators & __call__ usage

## 📚 Assignments Overview
**1️⃣ Using self**
👨‍🎓 Create a Student class using self to manage attributes and display student data.

**2️⃣ Using cls**
🧮 Counter class with a class variable and method to count created objects.

**3️⃣ Public Variables and Methods**
🚗 Car class demonstrates how to access public variables and methods externally.

**4️⃣ Class Variables & Methods**
🏦 Bank class with a class method to change the shared bank name across instances.

**5️⃣ Static Methods**
🧮 MathUtils provides a static method add(a, b) for simple math utilities.

**6️⃣ Constructors & Destructors**
🪵 Logger class shows constructor and destructor messages on object lifecycle.

**7️⃣ Access Modifiers**
👩‍💼 Employee demonstrates public, protected (_salary), and private (__ssn) variables.

**8️⃣ Using super()**
👩‍🏫 Teacher class inherits from Person and uses super() for constructor chaining.

**9️⃣ Abstract Classes**
📐 Shape is an abstract base class. Rectangle implements the area() method.

**🔟 Instance Methods**
🐶 Dog class has an instance method bark() that includes the dog’s name.

**1️⃣1️⃣ Class Methods**
📚 Book class counts total books created using a class method.

**1️⃣2️⃣ Static Methods**
🌡️ TemperatureConverter converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using a static method.

**1️⃣3️⃣ Composition**
🚘 Car uses an Engine object inside it, demonstrating composition.

**1️⃣4️⃣ Aggregation**
🏢 Department holds reference to an external Employee object (aggregation).

**1️⃣5️⃣ MRO & Diamond Inheritance**
🔁 Demonstrates D(B, C) class structure and how MRO works in multiple inheritance.

**1️⃣6️⃣ Function Decorators**
🎀 Logs "Function is being called" before execution using a decorator.

**1️⃣7️⃣ Class Decorators**
🙋 Adds a dynamic greet() method to a class via a class decorator.

**1️⃣8️⃣ Property Decorators**
💰 Product uses @property, @setter, and @deleter to manage _price.

**1️⃣9️⃣ __call__() and callable()**
📞 Multiplier class instances behave like functions using __call__().

**2️⃣0️⃣ Custom Exceptions**
🚫 InvalidAgeError is raised if age is less than 18 during validation.

**2️⃣1️⃣ Iterable Objects**
🔢 Countdown class becomes iterable using __iter__() and __next__().
